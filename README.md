# Dress up doll

Back to my teenage years designing and dressing characters from my imagination. These girls would become characters in my stories, comics and drawings.



I followed a tutorial, but aimed to make the code for recent HTML,CSS,JS versions. 
I also refactored my code to be more concise and scalable.
Basic tutorial from:
