Back to my teenage years designing and dressing characters from my imagination. These girls would become characters in my stories, comics and drawings.
**HTML5, CSS6, Vanilla JavaScript ES6.**
Illustrations and colouring done in Photoshop (not perfect yet).

**The Lonely Moongirl is a character from a short picture book I wrote last year :)**

I followed a tutorial, but aimed to make the code for recent HTML,CSS,JS versions. 
I also refactored my code to be more concise and scalable.
